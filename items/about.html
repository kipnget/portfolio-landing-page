    <p>
            I joined longisa high school in 2012 and finished in 2015. <br>After finishing from Longisa High School in 2015,<br> I was nervous to join to kemu university- a brand new place where I knew no one. <br>Thankfully, kemu fratermity and community welcomed me with open arms.<br> Throughout my undergraduate career, I loved coding and lived coding, deeply. <br>My four years at kemu shaped and molded me into the person I am today. <br>I was though lucky to
            yet join moringa again to deeply increase my passion for coding.<br> Its really  very nice place to be.
